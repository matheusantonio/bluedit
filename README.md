# Bluedit
*Reddit-like forum*

This is an attempt to make a Reddit-like forum to exercise my skills in .NET Core and to learn Angular. 

* The folder /bluedit contains the API with the backend and /bluedit-pages contains the frontend app in Angular that comunicates with the API.

* I also used MongoDB (which maybe wasn't the best option for an application like this) just for learning purposes and Material in Angular to help building my components.
